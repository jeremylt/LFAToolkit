## Diffusion operator

This is an example of various preconditioners for the 2D scalar diffusion problem.

### Problem formulation

The scalar diffusion problem is given by

```math
\nabla^2 u = f
```

with a weak form of

```math
\int_\Omega \nabla u \nabla v = \int_\Omega v f, \forall v \in V
```

for an appropriate test space ``V \subseteq H_0^1 \left( \Omega \right)`` on the domain.
In this weak formulation, boundary terms have been omitted, as they are not present on the infinite grid for Local Fourier Analysis.
