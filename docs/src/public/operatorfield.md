## Operator Field

The operator field object represents the different inputs and outputs for the finite element operator weak form.
In a Galerkin operator, inputs represent the finite element basis for unknown values and the basis evaluation modes, while the outputs represent the finite element basis for the test functions and their basis evaluation modes.
